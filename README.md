# AutoWisher
Sometimes,we forget to wish our friends or family on their special days.
As people are busy these days,it is not possible for everyone to remember the special days of their near and dear.
This project “Auto Wisher” help you to send automated wishes to all your friends and family on their special day. 
There are some webpages which help us to send automated wishes through Gmail App using spreadsheets.
Auto Wisher is a python extension that helps you to send wishes in Whatsapp to all your special ones. Sending wishes automatically is a great help for all those people who want to save their time and make others happy.
Scope of this project is limited to phone numbers saved in our contact list. That contact number must have whatsapp account in usage.
In this project,the python module used was "PyAutoGUI",which provides the ability to simulate mouse cursor moves and clicks as well as keyboard button presses.Using this automating module,we automated the process of opening whatsapp,typing the message in the respective chat and sending the message,thereby closing the whatsapp.
Sending auto wishes automatically to your near and dear on their special occasions makes it easy and with this application to everyone. The program perffunction with minimal or no human intervention and reduces the time. It will be a great help for all those people who want to save time and make others happy. Let's make their special day more special by wishing them using AutoWisher.
#Future Enhancements
This project can be developed further. We can improve this program to send wishes to 2 or more people at a time i.e., in a single execution,whose special occasions are on the same date. We can make changes in the program such that instead of giving contact number,we can give group name and we can automate messaging in the group. For now,we created custom messaging but we can improve that by providing some regularly used message contents so that users can directly choose their message rather than typing the message.
